# libUI
A Rusty user interface library that binds to platform native APIs. 
These are work-in-progress Rust bindings to the minimalistic native UI library [libui][libui].

## Building
`libui` is included as a submodule. You will need CMake to build `libui` itself; 
after that, Cargo should be able to take care of the build process.

Based on work by @pcwalton
